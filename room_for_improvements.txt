Current terraform code uses only free resources from AWS.

Its possible to use some paid resources to improve the code such as:
CloudWatch, SNS, S3, etc.

We could have used some of the AWS services to improve the code such as Cloudwatch alarms.
resource "aws_cloudwatch_metric_alarm" "high_cpu" {
  alarm_name          = "HighCPUAlarm"
  comparison_operator = "GreaterThanThreshold"
  evaluation_periods  = "2"
  metric_name         = "CPUUtilization"
  namespace           = "AWS/EC2"
  period              = "120"
  statistic           = "Average"
  threshold           = "75"

  dimensions = {
    AutoScalingGroupName = aws_autoscaling_group.swarm_asg.name
  }

  alarm_actions = [aws_autoscaling_policy.scale_up.arn]
}

or ASG scaling policies.
resource "aws_autoscaling_policy" "scale_up" {
  name                   = "scale_up_on_high_cpu"
  scaling_adjustment     = 2
  adjustment_type        = "ChangeInCapacity"
  cooldown               = "300"
  autoscaling_group_name = aws_autoscaling_group.swarm_asg.name
}

Fix the swarm nodes, to work in one cluster instead of 3.
